<h3>La La Land</h3>
<p>I love the music and the message that sometimes you have to make sacrifices to get where you want to be.</p>

<h3>This Is The End</h3>
<p>Seth Rogan's best movie. I love the premise of ficitonal and absurd things happening to 'real' people</p>

<h3>Kingsman: The Secret Service</h3>
<p>One of the best action movies of all time. Wonderfully shot and written.</p>
