        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
		<p>Most of my hobbies revolve around competition. I'm an avid gamer and sports enjoyer. My go-to game right now is Black Ops 6 even though I swore off CoD projects after Modern Warfare (2019). Other games I enjoy are Rocket League, Minecraft, and Baldur's Gate.</p>
        <p>I'm (unfortunately) a Houston sports fan so cheering for the Texans is constant practice on managing expectations. I'm just happy The Rockets are currently playing as well as they are! Go Stros! We need a Hockey team.</p>
        <p>Other than the typical tech bro stuff, I'm also extremely into music. I went to school for Audio Engineering and I've since engineered a couple of projects for myself and friends.</p>
